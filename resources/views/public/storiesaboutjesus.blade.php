            <h3>Mount of Temptation</h3>
            <p>
                This site is less certain than most other holy sites as being the true
                location, for where Jesus fasted for 40 days and nights. But there are
                some good reasons to believe it was in this area, like the fact that
                this area was, from time immemorial, a refuge for those who wished to
                isolate themselves from the world.

            <h3>Millstone Hung About the Neck</h3>
            <p>
                Millstones were used for grinding wheat or other grains. Many more
                millstones were found in Capernaum than what could've been used by its
                own inhabitants, which seems to indicate they were being made there out
                of the local, hard basalt rock, and sold to customers who lived elsewhere.
                "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, but whoever
                causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be
                better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and
                to be drowned in the depth of the sea" (Matthew 18:5-6).

            <h3>Northern Galilee</h3>
            <p>
                Galilee is a small, shallow, freshwater lake that gets stirred up very
                much and quickly, especially in January. A good contrast to compare is the
                ocean. Oceans require much more wind to change its ripples into waves,
                then it can take days afterward to calm down after a huge storm. A shallow
                lake, by contrast, develops waves much more unpredictably and suddenly,
                then can calm down to being mirror-like almost as soon as the wind stops.
                The ocean's waves also never obtain the same horizontal, narrow distance
                from their base to their crest, like a shallow lake's waves do. This means
                the sides of a shallow lake's waves are much steeper, which actually makes
                a shallow lake much more dangerous. Add to this the instability of the
                flat-bottomed boats the fishermen used in Jesus' day, compared to our
                modern-day boats with ballasts. And add to this the weather patterns of
                Galilee, which are due to the hills that surround the lake and the cool,
                prevailing westerly winds from the Mediterranean. The weather there is
                quite unpredictable, making Psalm 107:23-32 intensely real and personal
                to the fishermen of Jesus' day.

            <h3>Peter's House or "Insula"</h3>
            <p>
                This place in Capernaum is more than likely the location for Peter's house
                that existed in Jesus' day. Also, Peter's "insula" would've been built from
                the same basalt type of rock common to that area. But what remains there now
                was rebuilt, expanded, renovated, etc., from the way it was in Jesus' day,
                and archaeologists date these remains to an era of about 500 years after
                Jesus was here. Likely Peter's descendants and/or their friends continued to
                meet here in a house church after Peter died, and eventually it became more
                like a shrine, with pilgrims coming from afar to write their names on the
                walls, etc.

            <h3>Peter's Courtyard</h3>
            <p>
                Peter's courtyard gives a slightly better idea of what "insulas" were like in
                Jesus' day. The rooms they built were for sleeping in, and their courtyards
                were all fenced in not only to keep in their chickens, sheep, etc., but to
                help protect their women and children from outsiders.

            <h3>Pool of Siloam</h3>
            <p>
                Discovered in 2004 and partially restored (it used to be much bigger).
                John 9:3-7, "Jesus...spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva...
                anointed the man's eyes with the mud and said to him, 'Go, wash in the pool
                of Siloam' (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing."

            <h3>Passover Setting</h3>
            <p>
                The <a href="http://www.biblicalresources.net/jim-fleming-lectures.cfm">Biblical Resources Center</a>
                in LaGrange, Georgia, used to have a center in Israel when I went there in
                2002 and again in 2004. They served us tourists a Passover meal as part of
                our learning experience; this was before we sat down to eat.

            <h3>Pinnacle of the Temple</h3>
            <p>
                The pinnacle of the temple, where Jesus was tempted to throw himself down
                from, could've been next to the Kidron Valley on the eastern wall. This
                would've been a higher drop than even the south western corner shown in
                this picture. But many scholars believe it was more likely to be this south
                western corner where Jesus was tempted, because here the whole city could
                witness it, whereas hardly anyone would witness it in the Kidron Valley.
                Also, from here a priest would blow the trumpet to announce the beginning
                of Sabbath and other special events. So this corner became significant for
                the attention of the city's residents much like our media is to us today.
                And in the original Greek, "pinnacle" comes from a Greek word commonly used
                to refer to turret-like structures. Only later did its basic meaning change
                to the highest point.

            <h3>Southern Steps</h3>
            <p>
                Jews walked up these steps when approaching the temple, especially during the
                great pilgrimage festivals of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot. Christian
                archaeologists and scholars agree with 100% certainty that Jesus must've been
                here (see also a <a href="img/southern_steps_modern.webp">modern-day picture</a>
                of the restored southern steps). The temple itself was rebuilt in 1.5 years
                (back in 19 BC), and most of the temple mount was completed by 26 AD.

            <h3>Antonia Fortress</h3>
            <p>
                The Antonia Fortress was adjacent to the temple mount so the Roman Soldiers
                who resided in the fortress could quickly descend upon the temple precincts
                if there was a riot. Also, it was slightly taller than the temple was, to let
                the Jews know "who's boss" and effectively "rub it in their faces." This was
                traditionally where Jesus was beaten and condemned to die, but more likely,
                <a href="http://biblehub.com/topical/p/praetorium.htm">because of Josephus's</a>
                (and Philo's) writings, he was beaten and condemned in what became known as
                Herod's Palace. If this is true (which seems most likely), it changes the
                validity of the "Via Dolorosa" as being where Jesus walked to his crucifixion.

            <h3>Model of Golgotha</h3>
            <p>
                The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built on what is likely the site of
                Golgotha. In Jesus' time it was outside the city walls, but today it's within
                the old city walls because the old city today has its walls in a different
                place. There is no reason to believe that Jesus was crucified on top of a
                hill; he could've been crucified at the base of a hill. The Roman Catholic
                Church depicted the crucifixion at the top because it seems to exult Jesus
                better. But there is a good chance there's a hill there that looks like a
                skull, which is why the place was called "Golgotha." And this first-century
                replica of Jerusalem has such a hill on this site.
