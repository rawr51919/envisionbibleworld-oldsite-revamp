            <h4><em>We live in an age of opportunity unparalleled with any 
								other.</em></h4>
            <p>
                Have you ever considered the unique opportunities God gave us in 
								this age? An example being the current State of Israel allowing 
								archaeologists and scholars to learn more there about the Bible’s 
								background than ever before? Yet do you feel skeptical of the 
								conclusions reached when artifacts are dated as millions of years 
								old? If so, what solution would you come up with to reconcile 
								your interest in archaeological findings? And before spending any 
								time contemplating this, think also about one more thing. What 
								if understanding better the context of various Bible stories 
								could enable us to make even more appropriate applications for 
								living in today’s world?
            </p>

            <h4><em>By leaving all conclusions we believe to advanced scholars, 
								wouldn’t we be doing what the majority did during the medieval 
								ages?</em></h4>
            <p>
                By organizing desired data into a more elaborately thought-out 
								pattern, wouldn’t more accuracy and reliability come from the 
								conclusions we could draw? For example, I asked you how to increase 
								your interest in ancient artifacts. Wouldn’t it help if you could 
								sort by era, and have all those artifacts dated back to millions 
								of years ago grouped so now you can at least think to yourself, 
								“That’s what THEY say about all these artifacts, but I’ll believe 
								this instead.” In contrast, by leaving all the conclusions we 
								believe to advanced scholars, wouldn’t we be doing what the 
								majority did during the medieval ages? This reaction is even more 
								shameful when considering the ease of our technology today.

                We live in an age of opportunity unparalleled with any other. 
								Jesus said, “Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will 
								be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will 
								demand the more” (Luke 12:48b). This drives my passion.
