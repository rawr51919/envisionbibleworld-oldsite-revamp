            <h4><em>We live in an age of opportunity unparalleled with any
                                other.</em></h4>
            <p>
                Have you ever considered the unique opportunities God gave us in
                                this age? An example being the current State of Israel allowing
                                archaeologists and scholars to learn more there about the Bible’s
                                background than ever before? Yet do you feel skeptical of the
                                conclusions reached when artifacts are dated as millions of years
                                old? If so, what solution would you come up with to reconcile
                                your interest in archaeological findings? And before spending any
                                time contemplating this, think also about one more thing. What
                                if understanding better the context of various Bible stories
                                could enable us to make even more appropriate applications for
                                living in today’s world?
            </p>

            <h4><em>By leaving all conclusions we believe to advanced scholars,
                                wouldn’t we be doing what the majority did during the medieval
                                ages?</em></h4>
            <p>
                By organizing desired data into a more elaborately thought-out
                                pattern, wouldn’t more accuracy and reliability come from the
                                conclusions we could draw? For example, I asked you how to increase
                                your interest in ancient artifacts. Wouldn’t it help if you could
                                sort by era, and have all those artifacts dated back to millions
                                of years ago grouped so now you can at least think to yourself,
                                “That’s what THEY say about all these artifacts, but I’ll believe
                                this instead.” In contrast, by leaving all the conclusions we
                                believe to advanced scholars, wouldn’t we be doing what the
                                majority did during the medieval ages? This reaction is even more
                                shameful when considering the ease of our technology today.

                We live in an age of opportunity unparalleled with any other.
                                Jesus said, “Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will
                                be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will
                                demand the more” (Luke 12:48b). This drives my passion.
