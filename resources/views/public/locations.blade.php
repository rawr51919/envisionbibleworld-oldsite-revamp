            <h3>The Significance of Locations</h3>
            <p>
                For any Christian who has been to Israel, locations in the Bible,
        and even the distances between them, these start to matter in a
        way they never did before. I’ve been to Israel twice--the second
        time with a Christian archaeologist--and so I’ve been envisioning
        for some time a world where walking was the main mode of
        transportation. In this world, how significant is altitude! And
        yearly rainfall! But let’s just explore altitude for a bit, since
                yearly rainfall takes more explaining for Israel.

                Common travel routes were usually in valleys, which were easier
        to walk along than climbing tiring hills. Look out posts were on
        tall hills so they could visually communicate, since they didn’t
        have any other communication means. And vantage points during
        war—would you prefer to fight uphill, or down? Would you build a
        fortress at the bottom of a hill, or the top? But where would you
        find water? And if there was a siege on your fortress, how could
        you protect your water source from the enemy?

            <h3>The Significance of a Database on Locations</h3>
            <p>
                What if you could sort by altitude or yearly rainfall? Would you
        be more interested if you could easily click to see a map of
        where that place was? What if facts about a location were only
        another click away? What if you could easily find the history of
        a location despite its name changing twice in three different
        eras? What if you could easily find those three ways a place was
        spelled due to transliteration differences, frequently found in
        different maps and Bible versions?
