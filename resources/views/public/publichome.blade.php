            <h3>What I Have Is Extremely Contagious</h3>
            <p>
                I’ve been to Israel twice, once with a Christian archaeologist.
                                I’m FASCINATED by life as Jesus knew it, and by the Old Testament
                                as first century Jews knew it. It’s hard to recreate the past,
                                but I made a documentary from my footage with this focus. View the
                                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs8njgT0U30&feature=youtu.be">trailer</a>.
                                Launch your own fascination. See if you’ll find it contagious.

            <h3>What Did Going to Israel Do For Me?</h3>
            <p>
                Forgiveness is like buying a house. When you first determine to
                                forgive it’s like a huge down payment, and regularly afterwards,
                                more payments. More re-commitments to forgive. For 12 years I
                                was a mess. Actually from childhood I was a mess, but one domino
                                caused the next to fall, and the next, up until when I married
                                a man to escape my inability to heal from my emotional pain and
                                inefficient coping mechanisms. As my marriage was falling apart
                                my pain got 2-3 times worse than my failing marriage caused, due
                                to another individual’s deception (not my husband). Then, going
                                to Israel those 2 times—at the height of all this pain—gave me
                                a bigger boost healing than anything else ever could.

                        <h3><a href="">Why Did Going to Israel Make Such a Difference For Me?</a></h3>

                        <h3>What Can Encourage You?</h3>
            <p>
                As previously mentioned, I made a documentary called "Tour Israel
                                by Remote." I had planned to sell it but when completed, my
                                friends warned me it wasn't professional enough. This was
                                disappointing, besides the many other shut doors in my life. But
                                now I can easily publish segments of it in You Tube, giving you
                                a taste of touring Israel with a Christian archaeologist.

                See my <a href="/lifestylesofjesustime">pictures from Israel</a>,
                                the first of my
                                <a href="https://youtu.be/e6lBQ7GPqnQ">documentary segments</a>,
                                my <a href="/standard">research database</a>, and the
                                <a href="/deals">products and services</a> I’ll start recommending.
                                These all complement envisioning the Bible world. I’m convinced
                                this fascination is contagious, but my prayer is confidence in
                                God will become contagious, too.

          <h3>Who Would Make a Sensitive Audience?</h3>
            <p>
                Adults will benefit more if I write frankly about some
                                objectionable material for children, so I must caution Christian
                                parents. Like the news, occasional details can be too graphic.
                                Children younger than 12 should be excluded, or at least guided
                                through my blogs. Some products I recommend, and perhaps even a
                                <a href="/lifestylesofjesustime">picture from Israel (at the bottom)</a>,
                                may also be objectionable.
