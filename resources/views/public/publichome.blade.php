            <h3>What I Have Is Extremely Contagious</h3>
            <p>
                I’ve been to Israel twice, once with a Christian archaeologist. 
								I’m FASCINATED by life as Jesus knew it, and by the Old Testament 
								as first century Jews knew it. It’s hard to recreate the past, 
								but I made a documentary from my footage with this focus. View the
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs8njgT0U30&feature=youtu.be">trailer</a>.
								Launch your own fascination. See if you’ll find it contagious.
            </p>

            <h3>What Did Going to Israel Do For Me?</h3>
            <p>
                Forgiveness is like buying a house. When you first determine to 
								forgive it’s like a huge down payment, and regularly afterwards, 
								more payments. More re-commitments to forgive. For 12 years I 
								was a mess. Actually from childhood I was a mess, but one domino 
								caused the next to fall, and the next, up until when I married 
								a man to escape my inability to heal from my emotional pain and 
								inefficient coping mechanisms. As my marriage was falling apart 
								my pain got 2-3 times worse than my failing marriage caused, due 
								to another individual’s deception (not my husband). Then, going 
								to Israel those 2 times—at the height of all this pain—gave me 
								a bigger boost healing than anything else ever could.

						<h3><a href="">Why Did Going to Israel Make Such a Difference For Me?</a></h3>

						<h3>What Can Encourage You?</h3>
            <p>
                As previously mentioned, I made a documentary called "Tour Israel
								by Remote." I had planned to sell it but when completed, my 
								friends warned me it wasn't professional enough. This was 
								disappointing, besides the many other shut doors in my life. But 
								now I can easily publish segments of it in You Tube, giving you
								a taste of touring Israel with a Christian archaeologist.
            </p>

            <p>
                See my <a href="/lifestylesofjesustime">pictures from Israel</a>, 
								the first of my
								<a href="https://youtu.be/e6lBQ7GPqnQ">documentary segments</a>, 
								my <a href="/standard">research database</a>, and the
								<a href="/deals">products and services</a> I’ll start recommending. 
								These all complement envisioning the Bible world. I’m convinced 
								this fascination is contagious, but my prayer is confidence in 
								God will become contagious, too.
            </p>

          <h3>Who Would Make a Sensitive Audience?</h3>
            <p>
                Adults will benefit more if I write frankly about some 
								objectionable material for children, so I must caution Christian 
								parents. Like the news, occasional details can be too graphic. 
								Children younger than 12 should be excluded, or at least guided
								through my blogs. Some products I recommend, and perhaps even a
								<a href="/lifestylesofjesustime">picture from Israel (at the bottom)</a>, 
								may also be objectionable.
