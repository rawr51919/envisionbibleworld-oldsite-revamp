            <h3>Cobblestone Road in Nazareth</h3>
            <p>
                Local tour guides in Israel will usually tell you “this is where
		that happened in the Bible” with unquestioning certainty. Generally
                it sells better to say that, and local tourist industries profit 
                from this kind of publicity. But a Christian archaeologist explained 
		while I was in Israel that it’s usually complicated to trace the 
		certainty of where these places are located. Some places are more 
                certainly the true location than others, and this place—this 
		cobblestone road in Nazareth—is among the more certain places where 
                Jesus was.

            <h3>Insula</h3>
            <p>
                An “insula” is a compound where extended families lived in ancient 
		times. Grandparents typically lived with children, grandchildren  
		and possibly great-grandchildren. The size of an insula didn’t  
		indicate how rich the family was, because they could’ve just crammed 
		more people into that same insula. When a man was to get married,
		he would build a room onto the insula, then bring his wife to live
		with him and his parents, grandparents, etc. And since this was 
		what everyone did, Jesus used it to illustrate the home he has gone 
		to prepare for us, his bride, in John 14:2-3. “In my Father’s house
		are many rooms...and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will 
		come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be
		also.”

            <h3>Nazareth Hills from Mt. Carmel</h3>
            <p>
                Climbing Mt. Carmel allowed us this view of the Nazareth hills 
                (range of hills with some white on the horizon, from center to the 
		left). Mt. Carmel was where Elijah called down fire from the sky to 
		burn up the sacrifice on the altar (1 Kings 18:19, 38). See next for 
		a map of these locations plus another location referred to in 
		the next picture.

            <h3>Map of Israel & Pilgrims’ Route to Jerusalem</h3>
            <p>
                It probably took about a week for most pilgrims to travel from 
		Nazareth to Jerusalem, since they usually walked and used their 
		animals to carry their supplies. They would typically avoid Samaria 
		and travel mostly in the Jordan Valley, and of course they wouldn’t 
		travel on the Sabbath. See also Caesarea Maritima’s Aqueduct (next).

            <h3>Caesarea Maritima’s Aqueduct</h3>
            <p>
                Caesarea Maritima was a secular, Roman city in Jesus’ day, and 
		had a hippodrome and “plumbing,” which was advanced technology  
		for that time. The city was built above a grid of tunnels that seems to have 
		been washed daily with the tide, keeping the city smelling cleaner than 
		almost every other Roman city at that time. Conscientious Jews 
		wouldn’t have anything to do with a city like this, if they could 
		help it. But the aqueduct in the below picture was 7 km long and 
		used during Jesus’ time to carry water from the north east.

            <h3>Replica of First Century Jerusalem</h3>
            <p>
                I was more interested in picturing ancient Israel than I was in
		the churches built on holy sites. This replica enabled our Christian 
		archaeologist to explain where things were from stories in the Bible. 
		This view of the first-century Jerusalem has the Pool of Siloam in 
		the foreground, and the south side of the temple mount in the 
		background.

            <h3>Mikvahs</h3>
            <p>
                Mikvahs were much like mini pools except they were only used for 
		ritual cleansing. These mikvahs were on the south side of the 
		temple mount, where archaeological digging still reveals evidence 
		of them today. The Jews had to go into them for ritual cleansing 
		before going up into the temple. Outside were the beggars, believed 
		to be unclean because why else would they be born blind, maimed, 
		lame, deaf and mute, etc. (cp. John 9:2)? Beggars were perpetually 
		unclean because they were “born in sin,” so they would beg outside 
		the ritual cleansing places. There, outside the mikvahs, they could 
		obtain mercy from fellow Jews who might accidentally touch them 
		while giving their alms, but were about to be ritually cleansed
		anyway.

                Milestones indicated how far to the main destination, and this 
		one was a Roman milestone from 83 CE on the Antioch Akko Road.

            <p>
                In Caesarea Maritima these toilets are found in the entrance to 
		the hippodrome, showing how depraved the Romans were, since
                they didn’t need any privacy to do their business.

                At the Caesarea Maritima amphitheater, further proof of how depraved 
                the Romans were: this is where they kept the animals that were to devour 
                the Christians being persecuted, or other prisoners.
