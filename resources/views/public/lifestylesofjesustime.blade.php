            <h3>Cobblestone Road in Nazareth</h3>
            <p>
                Local tour guides in Israel will usually tell you “this is where
        that happened in the Bible” with unquestioning certainty. Generally
                it sells better to say that, and local tourist industries profit
                from this kind of publicity. But a Christian archaeologist explained
        while I was in Israel that it’s usually complicated to trace the
        certainty of where these places are located. Some places are more
                certainly the true location than others, and this place—this
        cobblestone road in Nazareth—is among the more certain places where
                Jesus was.

            <h3>Insula</h3>
            <p>
                An “insula” is a compound where extended families lived in ancient
        times. Grandparents typically lived with children, grandchildren
        and possibly great-grandchildren. The size of an insula didn’t
        indicate how rich the family was, because they could’ve just crammed
        more people into that same insula. When a man was to get married,
        he would build a room onto the insula, then bring his wife to live
        with him and his parents, grandparents, etc. And since this was
        what everyone did, Jesus used it to illustrate the home he has gone
        to prepare for us, his bride, in John 14:2-3. “In my Father’s house
        are many rooms...and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will
        come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be
        also.”

            <h3>Nazareth Hills from Mt. Carmel</h3>
            <p>
                Climbing Mt. Carmel allowed us this view of the Nazareth hills
                (range of hills with some white on the horizon, from center to the
        left). Mt. Carmel was where Elijah called down fire from the sky to
        burn up the sacrifice on the altar (1 Kings 18:19, 38). See next for
        a map of these locations plus another location referred to in
        the next picture.

            <h3>Map of Israel & Pilgrims’ Route to Jerusalem</h3>
            <p>
                It probably took about a week for most pilgrims to travel from
        Nazareth to Jerusalem, since they usually walked and used their
        animals to carry their supplies. They would typically avoid Samaria
        and travel mostly in the Jordan Valley, and of course they wouldn’t
        travel on the Sabbath. See also Caesarea Maritima’s Aqueduct (next).

            <h3>Caesarea Maritima’s Aqueduct</h3>
            <p>
                Caesarea Maritima was a secular, Roman city in Jesus’ day, and
        had a hippodrome and “plumbing,” which was advanced technology
        for that time. The city was built above a grid of tunnels that seems to have
        been washed daily with the tide, keeping the city smelling cleaner than
        almost every other Roman city at that time. Conscientious Jews
        wouldn’t have anything to do with a city like this, if they could
        help it. But the aqueduct in the below picture was 7 km long and
        used during Jesus’ time to carry water from the north east.

            <h3>Replica of First Century Jerusalem</h3>
            <p>
                I was more interested in picturing ancient Israel than I was in
        the churches built on holy sites. This replica enabled our Christian
        archaeologist to explain where things were from stories in the Bible.
        This view of the first-century Jerusalem has the Pool of Siloam in
        the foreground, and the south side of the temple mount in the
        background.

            <h3>Mikvahs</h3>
            <p>
                Mikvahs were much like mini pools except they were only used for
        ritual cleansing. These mikvahs were on the south side of the
        temple mount, where archaeological digging still reveals evidence
        of them today. The Jews had to go into them for ritual cleansing
        before going up into the temple. Outside were the beggars, believed
        to be unclean because why else would they be born blind, maimed,
        lame, deaf and mute, etc. (cp. John 9:2)? Beggars were perpetually
        unclean because they were “born in sin,” so they would beg outside
        the ritual cleansing places. There, outside the mikvahs, they could
        obtain mercy from fellow Jews who might accidentally touch them
        while giving their alms, but were about to be ritually cleansed
        anyway.

            <p>
                Milestones indicated how far to the main destination, and this
        one was a Roman milestone from 83 CE on the Antioch Akko Road.

            <h3>Roman Toilets</h3>
            <p>
                In Caesarea Maritima these toilets are found in the entrance to
        the hippodrome, showing how depraved the Romans were, since
                they didn’t need any privacy to do their business.

                At the Caesarea Maritima amphitheater, further proof of how depraved
                the Romans were: this is where they kept the animals that were to devour
                the Christians being persecuted, or other prisoners.
