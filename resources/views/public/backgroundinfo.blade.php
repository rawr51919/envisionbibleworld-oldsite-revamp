            <h3>What Versions of the Bible Are Used?</h3>
            <p>
                Those who know Hebrew and Greek agree that the NIV translators
                                were generally translating concept by concept, whereas the ESV
                                translators were generally translating word by word. This makes
                                the NIV better for reading the Old Testament, since Hebrew to
                                English must be concept by concept. Whereas the ESV is better
                                for the New Testament, since Greek to English is better word by
                                word.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The search function is effective only with predictable word
                                searches, so I decided it was necessary to be consistent with
                                the versions quoted. I chose to always quote the NIV for the Old
                                Testament, and the ESV for the New. If after I get almost the
                                whole Bible inputted, there’s more valued information by referring
                                to other versions, it will be the exception, and not the rule,
                                to include other translations.

            <h3>Will This Database Improve?</h3>
            <p>
                The research currently available in my database was uploaded from
                                my work done until May 2016. I still can’t input my new research
                                so the public can view it. Students will have to fix the bugs for
                                work experience in the spring of 2018 (in cooperation with a local
                                college’s program). My 2017 students had to do more behind-the-scenes
                                work. I continue to research, and in May 2018, Lord willing, more
                                data will be uploaded. Depending on how fast my students progress,
                                they may even start the <a href="/locations">mapping functions</a>,
                                in May 2018. See also plans for the <a href="/sacrifices">sacrifices</a>.

            <h3>Aren’t Interpretations of the Bible Controversial?</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes, but all my entries try to rigidly adhere to literal
                                summaries of Bible texts to give a relatively objective birds’
                                eye-view of the Bible’s contents. See also my
                                <a href="/beliefs">doctrinal statement</a>.

            <h3>Who Inputs into this Database?</h3>
            <p>
                Right now, I do, using primarily the Bible, Logos Bible Software,
                                numerous other books and the web to accumulate notes on the Old
                                Testament, Jesus’ era and ministry, in an intimately familiar
                                fashion. Perhaps eventually others will partner with me. If so,
                                I may eventually be able to get others inputting into my database,
                                too. I just started this <a href="/blog">blog</a>
                                and promoting my affiliate marketing business in October 2017. I
                                have no idea yet what the Lord may do with/for my database.
