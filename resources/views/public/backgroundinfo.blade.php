            <h3>What Versions of the Bible Are Used?</h3>
            <p>
                Those who know Hebrew and Greek agree that the NIV translators 
								were generally translating concept by concept, whereas the ESV 
								translators were generally translating word by word. This makes 
								the NIV better for reading the Old Testament, since Hebrew to 
								English must be concept by concept. Whereas the ESV is better 
								for the New Testament, since Greek to English is better word by 
								word.
						</p>
						<p>
								The search function is effective only with predictable word 
								searches, so I decided it was necessary to be consistent with 
								the versions quoted. I chose to always quote the NIV for the Old 
								Testament, and the ESV for the New. If after I get almost the 
								whole Bible inputted, there’s more valued information by referring 
								to other versions, it will be the exception, and not the rule, 
								to include other translations.

            <h3>Will This Database Improve?</h3>
            <p>
                The research currently available in my database was uploaded from 
								my work done until May 2016. I still can’t input my new research 
								so the public can view it. Students will have to fix the bugs for 
								work experience in the spring of 2018 (in cooperation with a local 
								college’s program). My 2017 students had to do more behind-the-scenes 
								work. I continue to research, and in May 2018, Lord willing, more 
								data will be uploaded. Depending on how fast my students progress, 
								they may even start the <a href="/locations">mapping functions</a>,
								in May 2018. See also plans for the <a href="/sacrifices">sacrifices</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Aren’t Interpretations of the Bible Controversial?</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes, but all my entries try to rigidly adhere to literal 
								summaries of Bible texts to give a relatively objective birds’ 
								eye-view of the Bible’s contents. See also my 
								<a href="/beliefs">doctrinal statement</a>.

            <h3>Who Inputs into this Database?</h3>
            <p>
                Right now, I do, using primarily the Bible, Logos Bible Software, 
								numerous other books and the web to accumulate notes on the Old 
								Testament, Jesus’ era and ministry, in an intimately familiar 
								fashion. Perhaps eventually others will partner with me. If so, 
								I may eventually be able to get others inputting into my database, 
								too. I just started this <a href="/blog">blog</a> 
								and promoting my affiliate marketing business in October 2017. I 
								have no idea yet what the Lord may do with/for my database.
