            <h3>Olive Press</h3>
            <p>
                Olives were about the most useful crop to ancient Israel, because
                their oil could be burned for light (Exodus 27:20), was used for
                anointing (Luke 7:46), medicine (Luke 10:34) and cooking, the pits
                (when crushed) had enough oil left in them to burn for heat, and the
                ashes after burning them could be used to make soap. This olive press
                was used to drain the oil out of the pits, after they were first
                crushed by this <a href="img/olive_crusher.webp">large stone wheel.</a>
                The olives were put into those black bags stacked under the long wooden
                pole, and weights were added to the pole for additional pressure,
                to obtain more oil after the first pressing. The quality of the oil
                deteriorated with each additional pressing; the oil first obtained was
                "virgin olive oil."

                This man was dressed in Bible-times attire and working with this donkey in
                Nazareth Village, which was a place for tourists to envision what life was
                like in Bible times. I <i>loved</i>

            <h3>Jordan River</h3>
            <p>
                The Jordan Valley is wide and flat, so the Jordan River runs snake-like
                back and forth a lot, and expands quite wide and shallow in places. But
                it can also become quite narrow like in this picture, where there's
                more steep embankment on both sides. And after the winter rains the
                amount of water that flows from north to south can substantially
                increase.

            <p>
                Drawing water from the well was the woman's job. Normally she wouldn't
                leave the insula without her brother, father or husband, but going to the
                well was the only exception. Women could go to the well by themselves
                (John 4:7-26).

            <h3>Canaanite Civilization from Abraham's Time</h3>
            <p>
                These foundations were uncovered in the "tel" called Megiddo, which is a
                man-made hill. To understand a tel, think of a location where an ancient
                civilization lives for perhaps a few hundred years, then war, or a plague,
                or a bad fire, or a combination of sad events takes place, leaving the
                location as a ghost town, or perhaps as a bunch of mere foundations and
                dead bodies. After say, a hundred more years, enough dirt blows over to
                bury all of the foundations, but perhaps not all of the remaining
                structures. Then new peoples move in and appropriate some of what was left
                from before. But also, they go out to find more rocks to build on top.
                Then this cycle repeats again, over and over, which eventually creates a
                man-made hill.

            <h3>Grain Silo</h3>
            <p>
                This grain silo was also found at Megiddo, which dates back to King
                Jeroboam in the 8th century BC. Since Megiddo was already becoming a hill
                from numerous civilizations beforehand, and since hills were good to build
                fortresses on, it seems at least by Solomon's time that's exactly what
                Megiddo became. And this grain silo would've fed King Jeroboam's soldiers
                who also would've lived in this fortress. Fortresses stored the valuables
                of the nation (like grain and oil), and since they were naturally the last
                places to fall when there was war, that's where the soldiers lived and
                practiced their warfare maneuvers.

            <h3>Valley of Armageddon</h3>
            <p>
                This valley is beside Megiddo and receives it's name from Megiddo ("Har"
                means mount and "mageddon" refers to Megiddo). This valley is probably one
                of the main reasons civilizations kept coming back to live on top of the
                ghost towns of past civilizations. It's fertile, and Megiddo also has a
                source of water, which is another reason civilizations kept coming back.
                But since it was a desirable place, many felt it was worth fighting for,
                which is why the Valley of Armageddon was the scene of much blood shed
                throughout history. And that's why in Revelation 16:16, the prophecy refers
                to this valley as being the place for the final battle at the end of time.
                Whether or not this is literally the place, the "Valley of Armageddon" was
                an appropriate name for this prophecy.

            <h3>Nomadic Tent</h3>
            <p>
                The promise of God in Exodus 3:8, that God would bring the
                Israelites to a land "flowing with milk and honey," speaks of two
                different lifestyles. In the north where there's more rain, the
                Israelites would farm, produce pollen, and the bees would produce
                honey. In the south where there's hardly any rain, there's hardy,
                sparse weeds. The Israelites would continue their shepherding
                heritage and nomadic lifestyles there, that they inherited from
                their parents wandering in the wilderness. Their goats would
                produce lots of milk, making life so different in the north from
                the south. This type of nomadic tent was also home to Abraham,
                Isaac and Jacob, who also lived as nomads.

                As Hezekiah prepared for battle with the Assyrians, "...he worked
                hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building
                towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced
                the terraces of the City of David. He also made large numbers of
                weapons and shields" (2 Chronicles 32:5).

            <h3>Mount Sodom</h3>
            <p>
                Tradition indicates the remains of Sodom and Gomorrah were covered by
                the Dead Sea, which is in the background of this picture. This hill is
                a mineral and salt-rich mound which inherits the name "Sodom," because
                of this tradition.

            <p>
                Paul the Apostle was sharing his testimony years after he was saved,
                saying, "And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice
                saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting
                me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads'" (Acts 26:14). Are you
                kicking against the goads?

            <h3>Sheep Fold</h3>
            <p>
                Sheep were usually kept in the arid land to the south so there
                                was no danger of them ruining the neighbor's crops. If they were
                                kept in a northern village where farming was the norm, they would
                                have to be fenced in most of the time. Even in the arid south,
                                fences were frequently made to protect sheep from wild animals.
                                But in the south it wasn't typical to also build a house, at least
                                not the farther south one lived. Because there, shepherds had to
                                keep moving to find the scarce, hardy weeds that could feed their
                flocks.
