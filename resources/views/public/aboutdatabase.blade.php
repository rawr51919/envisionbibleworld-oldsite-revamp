                Do you feel like Googling information on Jesus? Clearly Jesus
                                is the most controversial person that ever lived! Googling will
                                bring up all the “riff raff” along with what you consider to be
                                “the good stuff.” Certainly, I’ll have a belief about Jesus that
                                may or may not sit well with you. You’ll have to
                                <a href="beliefs">keep reading</a> to find out.

            <h3>How Can I Reach My Own Conclusions Confidently?</h3>
            <p>
                If I could just remember where I heard this or that…. What if
                                the contents of the Dead Sea Scrolls, other ancient writings,
                                archaeological findings, etc., were all topically combined with
                                minute details of the Bible, giving a more organized and complete
                                picture of ancient near eastern life? I may not trust the other
                                sources like I do the Bible, but if I could just remember WHERE
                                I read this or that…

            <h3>How Can You Reach Your Own Conclusions Confidently?</h3>
            <p>
                As an aspiring biblical fiction writer, I wanted to significantly
                                close the gaps of misunderstanding and disconnect created by time,
                                culture and distance. Although the Bible is inspired and all
                                other sources plus my fiction won’t be, we can learn a fair bit
                                from other sources. With a better understanding of the original
                                context we can also apply lessons more wisely. I went to Israel
                                twice for this reason, and learned so much it seemed critical to
                                give as many insights to as many as possible. My
                                <a href="blog">blog</a> and
                                <a href="https://youtu.be/IpdBJZXOWL8">documentary segments</a>
                                are easier and faster ways to address this need. My
                                <a href="limits">database</a> is a work in progress, but has
                                potential to address these concerns better, at least eventually.
                                Before I start writing Biblical fiction, though, <em>I’ll need
                                people to be able to check my sources if they want to.</em> So
                                my goal is you will be able to draw your own conclusions about
                                my fiction confidently, at least if I ever write it someday.
