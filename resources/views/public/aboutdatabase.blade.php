                Do you feel like Googling information on Jesus? Clearly Jesus 
								is the most controversial person that ever lived! Googling will 
								bring up all the “riff raff” along with what you consider to be 
								“the good stuff.” Certainly, I’ll have a belief about Jesus that 
								may or may not sit well with you. You’ll have to 
								<a href="/beliefs">keep reading</a> to find out.

            <h3>How Can I Reach My Own Conclusions Confidently?</h3>
            <p>
                If I could just remember where I heard this or that…. What if 
								the contents of the Dead Sea Scrolls, other ancient writings, 
								archaeological findings, etc., were all topically combined with 
								minute details of the Bible, giving a more organized and complete 
								picture of ancient near eastern life? I may not trust the other 
								sources like I do the Bible, but if I could just remember WHERE 
								I read this or that…

            <h3>How Can You Reach Your Own Conclusions Confidently?</h3>
            <p>
                As an aspiring biblical fiction writer, I wanted to significantly 
								close the gaps of misunderstanding and disconnect created by time, 
								culture and distance. Although the Bible is inspired and all 
								other sources plus my fiction won’t be, we can learn a fair bit 
								from other sources. With a better understanding of the original 
								context we can also apply lessons more wisely. I went to Israel 
								twice for this reason, and learned so much it seemed critical to 
								give as many insights to as many as possible. My 
								<a href="/blog">blog</a> and 
								<a href="https://youtu.be/IpdBJZXOWL8">documentary segments</a> 
								are easier and faster ways to address this need. My 
								<a href="/limits">database</a> is a work in progress, but has 
								potential to address these concerns better, at least eventually. 
								Before I start writing Biblical fiction, though, <em>I’ll need 
								people to be able to check my sources if they want to.</em> So 
								my goal is you will be able to draw your own conclusions about
								my fiction confidently, at least if I ever write it someday.
