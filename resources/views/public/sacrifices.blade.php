            <h3>The Significance of Sacrifices</h3>
            <p>
                Who cares about sacrifices in the Old Testament? We as Christians
        live by the New Testament! But have you ever tried to read through
        Leviticus? Would you find it easier if you could envision patterns
        instead of repetition? Would you connect with it better if you
        envisioned life as a conscientious Jew learning at the feet of
        Jesus? Would you care more if you grasped just how Jesus perfectly
        fulfilled the law--ALL the law--on our behalf? So we wouldn’t have
                to sacrifice any more?

                We all could benefit more from the discipline of thankfulness, but
        how can we be thankful for things we can’t appreciate? And how can
        we appreciate if we can’t comprehend? Wouldn’t this alone make the
        exercise of exploring the sacrifices worth the effort?
