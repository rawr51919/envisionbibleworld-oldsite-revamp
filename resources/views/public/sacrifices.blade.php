            <h3>The Significance of Sacrifices</h3>
            <p>
                Who cares about sacrifices in the Old Testament? We as Christians 
		live by the New Testament! But have you ever tried to read through 
		Leviticus? Would you find it easier if you could envision patterns 
		instead of repetition? Would you connect with it better if you 
		envisioned life as a conscientious Jew learning at the feet of 
		Jesus? Would you care more if you grasped just how Jesus perfectly 
		fulfilled the law--ALL the law--on our behalf? So we wouldn’t have 
                to sacrifice any more?

            <p>
                We all could benefit more from the discipline of thankfulness, but 
		how can we be thankful for things we can’t appreciate? And how can 
		we appreciate if we can’t comprehend? Wouldn’t this alone make the 
		exercise of exploring the sacrifices worth the effort?
