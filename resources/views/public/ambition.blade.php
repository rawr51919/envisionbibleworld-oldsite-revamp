        <h1>What Drove My Ambition?</h1>

                            When I was 12 years old I read a fiction book that was so awesome,
                            you could say it blind-sided me. I went around starry-eyed for
                            days, and was smitten with determination the rest of my life.
                            Determination I WILL write books like that someday. I have been
                            like that ever since. But since I was around 30 years old, I
                            developed a need for good research.

              I used to highlight and tag my books to death. How can I find
                            where I read this or that when I need it? The more I learned,
                            the more I realized the potential of research, if only I could
                            find it again later. I started tracking research on the computer.

              My computerized system of tracking was primitive. It couldn't grow
                            as my research grew. Then at one of my jobs as an administrative
                            assistant, I found the answer: a research database!

            <p>
                            This wasn't easy for me to create since usually such projects take
                            a team of specialties to develop. That costs big bucks! Since 2016,
                            however, I've been happy to have my
                            "<a href="/publicstandard">first version</a> of this database
                            on-line.
